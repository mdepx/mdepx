# Thread module

## Introduction

Thread API manages a struct thread. Threads are used by the scheduler.

## Methods

* * *
    struct thread *
    mdx_thread_create(const char *name, int prio, uint32_t quantum_usec,
        uint32_t stack_size, void *entry, void *arg);

Dynamicaly allocates a thread and a stack space for it. Stack size is provided in bytes, quantum is in microseconds (usecs). Thread's priority *prio*, name *name*, entry point *entry* and a user argument *arg* should also be provided.

Note that the quantum could be specified as 0, the cooperative scheduling mode is used in that case.

Returns a pointer to the allocated thread or NULL if allocation fails.

Successfully allocated thread can be added to the scheduler's run queue using *mdx_sched_add(td)* immediately.

* * *
    int
    mdx_thread_setup(struct thread *td, const char *name,
        int prio, uint32_t quantum_usec, void *entry, void *arg);

Used to configure a statically allocated thread *td* with name *name*, priority *prio*, entry point *entry* and argument for the entry point *arg*. Thread quantum specified in microseconds and then converted to raw timer ticks by *mdx_callout_usec_to_ticks()*.

A thread must have *td->td_stack* allocated and *td->td_stack_size* set before calling this function.

* * *
    void
    mdx_thread_terminate(void);

Used by a thread to terminate itself at any given time. Could not be used in the exception time.

This is a function a thread goes into after returning from entry point.

* * *
    void
    mdx_thread_yield(void);

Used by a thread to leave the CPU. Only effective if thread's quantum initialized to 0 (cooperative scheduling mode).
